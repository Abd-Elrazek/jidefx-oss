All open source projects from JIDE Software are dual-licensed. The two licenses are GPL with classpath exception (http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html, the same license as OpenJDK) and free commercial license (http://www.jidesoft.com/purchase/SLA.htm). You can click on the links to see more information. The first license is the most widely used license among open source community. It is also the same license under which OpenJDK is open sourced. The second license is the original commercial license under which all other JIDE products are released, except it is free of charge in this case. We released under this license so that all existing paid JIDE customers can keep the existing commerical license agreement without switching to the open source license.
